----------- NUMERICAL data Distribution -----------------
# Skewness of the data (looking into symmetry of  Distribution) and Kurtosis the degree of the assymetry: 
- the degree_spondylolisthesis shows high Skewness: if I will use some linear models that i have to transform it. 
- all the other numberical columns show the moderate values for the Skewness
- in general for the normal Distribution Skewness not more then abs(0.5) is considered as normal distribution 
- the Kurtosis values tells about the potential outliers, the degree_spondylolisthesis has the highes value for the kurtosis. 
- and all the other columns might also have outliers


---- Multicollinearity------------
all features except 5  degree_spondylolisthesis show high collinearity
⚠️  Features with high VIF (>10) indicating multicollinearity:
                 Feature        VIF

1            pelvic_tilt        inf
2  lumbar_lordosis_angle  18.942994
3           sacral_slope        inf
4          pelvic_radius  12.282573
