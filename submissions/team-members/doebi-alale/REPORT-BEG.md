## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Setup & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    > Answer the EDA questions provided in the project materials here. Focus on data quality, trends, anomalies, and relationships.

    ### üîë Question 1: Which features are most strongly correlated with spinal abnormalities?

    ### üîë Question 2: Are any features linearly dependent on others (e.g., sacral slope and pelvic incidence)?

    ### üîë Question 3: Do biomechanical measurements cluster differently for normal vs. abnormal cases?

    ### üîë Question 4: Are there multicollinearity issues that impact modeling?

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Model Development

> This phase spans 3 weeks. Answer each set of questions weekly as you build, train, evaluate, and improve your models.

### üîç Week 1: Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

#### üîë Question 1:
    **Which biomechanical features show the strongest relationship with the target (spinal condition), and how did you determine this?**

    üí° **Hint:**  
    Use `.groupby(target).mean()`, `.corr()`, and plots like `boxplot` or `violinplot` to inspect feature separation by class.  
    Consider using statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA or t-tests) to validate separation.

    ‚úèÔ∏è Answer:

    To identify the biomechanical features most strongly associated with the spinal condition, I combined exploratory analysis, correlation metrics, and statistical testing:

    'dataset.groupby('class').mean()' allowed me to compare the average values of each biomechanical feature across the spinal condition classes (normal vs. abnormal). Features with large differences between groups hinted at a strong relationship with the condition.

#### üîë Question 2:
    Before building any model, what patterns or class imbalances did you observe in the target variable? Will this affect your modeling choices?

    ‚úèÔ∏è Answer:

    class 0 count is 100
    class 1 count is 210

    The class is imbalanced with the count favoring the abnormal class.

#### üîë Question 3:
    **Which features appear skewed or contain outliers, and what transformations (if any) did you apply to address them?**  

    üí° **Hint:**  
    Use `.hist()`, `df.skew()`, or boxplots.  
    Try log-transform or standardize features if skewed.  
    Consider z-score or IQR for outlier detection.

#### üîë Question 4:
    **What scaling method did you apply to your numerical features, and why was it necessary (or not) for the algorithms you plan to use?**  

    üí° **Hint:**  
    Logistic regression and distance-based models require scaling.  
    Tree-based models do not.  
    Use `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` as needed. Justify your choice.

#### üîë Question 5:
    **Did you create any new features that might help distinguish between different spinal conditions? If yes, what are they and what was the reasoning behind them?**  

    üí° **Hint:**  
    Try feature ratios or differences, like `pelvic_incidence - pelvic_tilt`.  
    Use domain insight or trial-and-error to create potentially useful features.
