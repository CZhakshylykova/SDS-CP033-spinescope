### Week 1: Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

---

#### Question 1:
**Which biomechanical features show the strongest relationship with the target (spinal condition), and how did you determine this?**

The features showing the strongest relationship with the target (spinal condition) are `degree_spondylolisthesis`, `pelvic_incidence`, and `lumbar_lordosis_angle`. This was determined using `.groupby('class').mean()`, correlation heatmaps, and boxplots. These features showed clear separation between Normal and Abnormal cases, with `degree_spondylolisthesis` especially high in Abnormal cases.

#### Question 2:
**Before building any model, what patterns or class imbalances did you observe in the target variable? Will this affect your modeling choices?**

There is a slight class imbalance, with more Abnormal than Normal cases. This was checked using `.value_counts()` and bar plots. While not extreme, I will apply stratified train-test splits and consider class weights in some models to avoid bias toward the majority class.

#### Question 3:
**Which features appear skewed or contain outliers, and what transformations (if any) did you apply to address them?**

Features like `degree_spondylolisthesis`, `pelvic_tilt`, and `pelvic_incidence` showed noticeable skewness and outliers. I applied capping using the IQR method to reduce extreme values. For the engineered feature `sacral_slope_divided_by_pelvic_incidence`, I applied an additional 99th percentile cap after observing a long right tail with extreme outliers (max ~2034 reduced to ~8.6). These steps help prepare the data for models sensitive to extreme values.

#### Question 4:
**What scaling method did you apply to your numerical features, and why was it necessary (or not) for the algorithms you plan to use?**

I applied `StandardScaler` to standardize numerical features to zero mean and unit variance, preparing the data for algorithms like logistic regression, SVM, and KNN, which are sensitive to feature scales. For tree-based models, scaling is not required, but having standardized features keeps modeling flexible.

#### Question 5:
**Did you create any new features that might help distinguish between different spinal conditions? If yes, what are they and what was the reasoning behind them?**

Yes, I created two derived features:
- `pelvic_incidence_minus_pelvic_tilt` (difference between pelvic incidence and pelvic tilt)
- `sacral_slope_divided_by_pelvic_incidence` (ratio of sacral slope to pelvic incidence, with +1e-6 to avoid division by zero)

These features aim to capture biomechanical relationships not fully expressed by individual variables and may enhance the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal spinal conditions.

#### Additional Notes 

## Handling Skew and Scaling

During preprocessing, I considered applying a log transformation (e.g., `np.log1p()`) to reduce skew in highly right-skewed features, such as `degree_spondylolisthesis`. This can help normalize distributions and improve model performance, especially for models sensitive to non-normality.

I also considered using `RobustScaler` to rescale features using the median and interquartile range (IQR), which can be more robust to outliers compared to `StandardScaler`.

However, after capping extreme values using the IQR method, I decided that applying `StandardScaler` would be sufficient for preparing the data, especially since I plan to experiment with both scale-sensitive (e.g., logistic regression, SVM) and scale-insensitive (e.g., tree-based) models
